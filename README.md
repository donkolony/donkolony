<h2>I'm a Developer & Engineer</h2>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Dieudone Kolony, a frontend developer with a civil engineering brain and a butterfly spirit. I’m constantly evolving, learning, and building meaningful things for the web. My journey started with drafting roads and structures, but now I craft digital interfaces that are just as carefully engineered. Since switching paths in 2023, I’ve been freelancing at Ouicestnous, developing responsive web apps with React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I approach every project like a metamorphosis, emerging stronger and sharper with every challenge. Whether I'm debugging code or designing layouts, I bring a structured, curious mindset and a drive to create things that are both beautiful and functional. Always flying forward, always learning.</p>

- 👀 I’m interested in creative frontend projects, web interactions, and human-centered design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React deeper, sharpening my JavaScript, and exploring component libraries like Tailwind and Framer Motion.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on frontend projects, personal websites, portfolio builds, or anything that lets creativity and code meet
- 📫 How to reach me donkolony@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-kolony/
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love reverse-engineering UIs I see online just to rebuild them my way & still sketch layout ideas like I’m drafting blueprints
