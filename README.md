    <h2>I'm a Developer & Engineer</h2>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Dieudone Kolony, a frontend developer with a civil engineering
      brain and a butterfly spirit. I’m constantly evolving, learning, and
      building meaningful things for the web. My journey started with drafting
      roads and structures, but now I craft digital interfaces that are just as
      carefully engineered. Since switching paths in 2023, I’ve been freelancing
      at Ouicestnous, developing responsive web apps with React, JavaScript,
      HTML, and CSS. I approach every project like a metamorphosis, emerging
      stronger and sharper with every challenge. Whether I'm debugging code or
      designing layouts, I bring a structured, curious mindset and a drive to
      create things that are both beautiful and functional. Always flying
      forward, always learning.
    </p>

        - 👀 I'm interested in creative frontend projects, web interactions, and
        human-centered design
      </li>
      <li>
        - 🌱 I'm currently learning React deeper, sharpening my JavaScript, and
        exploring component libraries like Tailwind and Framer Motion.
      </li>
      <li>
        - 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on frontend projects, personal
        websites, portfolio builds, or anything that lets creativity and code
        meet
      </li>

      <li>
        - ⚡ Fun fact: I love reverse-engineering UIs I see online just to
        rebuild them my way & still sketch layout ideas like I'm drafting
        blueprints
