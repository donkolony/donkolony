<h1>Hello and Welcome👋, I’m Dieudone Kolony (aka Don)</h1> <br/>
<h2>I'm a Developer & Engineer</h2>
<h3>💡 The Dev Behind the Code</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Dieudonne Kolony, a frontend web developer with a civil engineering brain and a butterfly spirit. I’m constantly evolving, learning, and building meaningful things for the web. My journey began with curiosity in 2023 and quickly turned into a passion for crafting clean, responsive digital experiences.

I started out drafting roads and structures, and now I engineer elegant user interfaces with React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Through freelancing at Ouicestnous, I’ve gained hands-on experience building real-world web applications and collaborating with clients to bring their visions to life.

I approach every project like a metamorphosis, emerging stronger and sharper with every challenge. Whether I’m debugging code or designing layouts, I bring a structured, curious mindset and a drive to create things that are both beautiful and functional. Always flying forward. Always learning</p>

- 👀 I’m interested in creative frontend projects, web interactions, and human-centered design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React deeper, sharpening my JavaScript, and exploring component libraries like Tailwind and Framer Motion.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on frontend projects, personal websites, portfolio builds, or anything that lets creativity and code meet
- 📫 How to reach me Dieudonne.Kolony@outlook.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-kolony/
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love reverse-engineering UIs I see online just to rebuild them my way & still sketch layout ideas like I’m drafting blueprints
